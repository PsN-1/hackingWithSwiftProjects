# All the completed Hacking With Swift projects


## Challenges

___
### **_Challenge of projects 7-9 finished!_**

*The challenge was a to make a simple hangman game, but it's was also a bit tricky, and I also got a few ideas.*

*I was supposed to create the game in a table view, displaying the word with "?" and the player's score in the navigation bar, instead:*

* The labels, image view and the constraints were added programmatically
* Replace the "?" with "_" and used a label to display the word
* Created the images with MS Excel in 2min.
* Load all the words from a file
* Chars in swift is pretty tricky, need to think a lot of ways to make fully work.

### **_Challenge of projects 10-12 finished!_**

*The challenge was to combine 2 previous projects, let users take photos with the camera or chose them from the photo library, add captions to it then display in a table view, with a second view showing the full image if selected*

* I tried to complete this challenge real quick, so didn't pay much attention to ui details.

### **_Challenge of projects 13-15 finished!_**

*The challenge was to create a app with a table view that displayed a small list of countries and a second view with some details of the selected country.*
*I got a little bit excited and went a bit further:*

* Got the data from a API (https://restcountries.eu),
* Created a webView to display the flag (because the format is .svg), and adjusted the CSS to make the image full,
* Created a filter to make it easy to find a specific country.
