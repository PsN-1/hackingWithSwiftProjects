# All the completed Hacking With Swift projects

___
### **_Challenge of projects 13-15 finished!_**

*The challenge was to create a app with a table view that displayed a small list of countries and a second view with some details of the selected country.*
*I got a little bit excited and went a bit further:*

* Got the data from a API (https://restcountries.eu),
* Created a webView to display the flag (because the format is .svg), and adjusted the CSS to make the image full,
* Created a filter to make it easy to find a specific country.
